# Grade AI

A basic AI tool for predicting future grades depending on some factors. This was made in response to a challenge presented in my computer science class. Hope that I made the mark.

## How-To-Use

```
git clone https://github.com/ShibaRed4/GradeAI.git
cd GradeAI

npm install
npm run dev

(if you have Bun installed, replace 'npm' with 'bun')
```

## PS:

The data may not be accurate as I do not have the time nor resources to pool accurate information. A lot of the information the model was trained on was almost-randomly generated.
